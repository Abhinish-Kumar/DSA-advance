# Queue


Defination:- A	queue	is	an	ordered	list	in	which	insertions	are	done	at	one	end	(rear)	and
 deletions	are	done	at	other	end	(front).	The	first	element	to	be	inserted	is	the	first	one	to	be
 deleted.	Hence,	it	is	called	First	in	First	out	(FIFO)	or	Last	in	Last	out	(LILO)	list.

 Similar	to	Stacks,	special	names	are	given	to	the	two	changes	that	can	be	made	to	a	queue.	When
 an	element	is	inserted	in	a	queue,	the	concept	is	called	EnQueue,	and	when	an	element	is
 removed	from	the	queue,	the	concept	is	called	DeQueue.

DeQueueing	an	empty	queue	is	called	underflow	and	EnQueuing	an	element	in	a	full	queue	is
 called	overflow. 	Generally,	we	treat	them	as	exceptions.
