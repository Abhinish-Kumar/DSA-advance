## What is a **Structure**?

A **structure** is a way to group different pieces of related information together. Think of it like a container that holds various items that are logically connected.
eg:- 
1. If you want to store details about a student, such as their name, roll number, and marks, you can use a structure to keep all this information together in one place.
2. Similarly, for a complex number, you can group its real part and imaginary part together using a structure.

In simple terms, a structure is like a blueprint that organizes complex data in a clear and meaningful way. Each item within the structure is called a **member**.
