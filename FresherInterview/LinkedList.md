## Linked List

| Problem                                                          | Description                                                                 |

| **Reverse a linked list**                                        | Reverse the pointers of a linked list to make the last node the head.       |
| **Detect a cycle in a linked list (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection)**    | Use two pointers (slow and fast) to detect if a linked list has a cycle.    |
| **Merge two sorted linked lists**                                | Combine two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.                |
| **Remove nth node from the end of the linked list**              | Remove the nth node from the end by using two-pointer technique.            |
| **Find the middle of a linked list**                             | Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the middle node of the list.       |
| **Check if a linked list is a palindrome**                       | Determine if the linked list reads the same forward and backward.           |
