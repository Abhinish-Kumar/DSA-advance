| **Implement a hash map from scratch**                             | Design a basic hash map data structure, including methods for insertion, deletion, and retrieval. |
| **Find the first non-repeating character in a string**            | Identify the first character in a string that does not repeat.              |
| **Count frequencies of elements in an array**                     | Calculate how often each element appears in an array.                       |
| **Check if two strings are anagrams**                             | Determine if two strings are anagrams, meaning they contain the same characters in a different order. |
| **Find the longest consecutive sequence in an array**             | Identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements in an unsorted array. |
