| **Binary Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)**          | Traverse a binary tree using Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder techniques.   |
| **Find the height of a binary tree**                              | Calculate the maximum depth or height of a binary tree.                     |
| **Check if two trees are identical**                              | Determine if two binary trees are structurally identical with the same values. |
| **Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree**                       | Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.              |
| **Implement Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS)** | Perform DFS and BFS on a graph or tree structure.                        |
| **Detect a cycle in a graph**                                     | Use DFS or BFS to check if a cycle exists in a directed or undirected graph.|
