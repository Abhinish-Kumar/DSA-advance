## What is an Array?

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

## Why Use Arrays?

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. They allow for efficient access to elements based on their indices. This makes them a fundamental data structure for various applications.


## Key Concepts of Arrays

1. Indexing:
- Arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on
- This allows you to access any element directly using its index. For example, if `arr` is an array, `arr[0]` accesses the first element.

2. Fixed Size:
- The size of an array is determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed. This means you need to know the number of elements you will store in advance.

3. Homogeneous Elements:
- Arrays can only store elements of the same type (e.g., all integers, all floats, all characters).

4. Contiguous Memory Allocation:
- Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient access and manipulation.














## Summary 

An array is a fundamental data structure that organizes items sequentially, one after the other, in memory. This simple yet powerful structure is crucial for solving many types of problems effectively, as it allows quick access to items based on their indices. It is essential in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) as it serves as a foundation for understanding more complex structures.
