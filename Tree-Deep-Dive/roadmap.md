### Key Concepts to Focus On:
- **BST Properties**: Left child is smaller, right child is larger.
- **In-order Traversal**: It gives elements in sorted order for a BST.
- **Recursion**: Many BST problems can be solved recursively (especially traversal and searching problems).
- **Time Complexity**: Understand time complexities of operations like insertion, deletion, and searching in balanced vs unbalanced BSTs.
- **Tree Rotations**: In AVL and Red-Black trees, rotations are important for maintaining balance.
  
### Advanced Data Structures Related to BST:
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Red-Black Tree**: A balanced BST that enforces balancing through color-based rules.
- **Splay Tree**: A self-adjusting tree that moves accessed elements to the root.

These questions cover a wide range of topics and will give you a solid grasp of BST-related problems in technical interviews.
